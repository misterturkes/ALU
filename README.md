# ALU
Arithmetic Logic Unit designed in MIPS processor language simulated by MARS

Within you will find the main files required to run this program. There are two Macro files that contain all every Macro the program will run. The Common Macros are simple but important
functions that allow for faster coding while the program specific ones are essential to handling the ALU side of things

The ALU can do all simple arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide). This can be expanded upon to be able to process bit shifts, logical operations, and bitwise
operations.
